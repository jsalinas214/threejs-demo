## Features

- Interactive 3D scene rendering with Three.js.
- Basic WebGL-powered graphics, including geometry, lighting, and materials.
- Easy-to-modify codebase for learning and experimentation.
- No build tools required—uses CDNs for simplicity.

## Demo

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- No additional software or dependencies required.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jsalinas214/threejs-demo.git
   cd threejs-demo

2. **Open the project**:
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the demo. For example:
      - On Windows: Double-click `index.html` or drag it into your browser.
      - On macOS/Linux: Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with" your browser.

*Note*: If you encounter CORS issues when testing locally, consider using a local server like Live Server (see [Usage](#usage)).

## Usage

- Open `index.html` in a browser to view the demo.
- Modify the JavaScript file `main.js` to customize the 3D scene, such as adding new objects, adjusting lighting, or changing camera settings.
- **Optional**: To avoid CORS issues when testing locally, use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension in VS Code:
  1. Install VS Code if you don’t have it ([download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
  2. Install the Live Server extension.
  3. Open the project folder in VS Code.
  4. Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server" to launch the demo at `http://localhost:5500`.
